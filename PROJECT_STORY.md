# Guide: Your Intelligent Companion for Vocational Guidance üéØ

## üåü The Inspiration: A National Problem Affecting Millions of Lives

### The Moment of Revelation

Like many Mexican young people, I found myself at that terrifying crossroads between ages 17 and 18: **What career should I choose?** But my story isn't unique. In Mexico, **7 out of 10 young people between 17-30 years old report vocational anxiety**, and the statistics are alarming:

- **45% of students drop out of university** in the first two years
- **60% of graduates work in areas different** from their training
- **80% of Mexican youth never received professional** vocational guidance
- **3.2 million young people** are in "nini" situation (neither studying nor working)

### The Real Problems I Observed

During my research, I identified the **five critical problems** faced by Mexican youth:

#### 1. **Massive Misinformation** üìö

- Decisions based on family myths: _"Medicine makes money"_, _"Engineering is only for men"_
- Total ignorance of the real job market
- Outdated information about emerging careers (UX/UI, Data Science, Sustainability)

#### 2. **Emotional Isolation** üíî

- Suffocating family pressure to choose "traditional" careers
- Paralyzing anxiety about the most important decision of their lives
- Lack of emotional support during the selection process
- Post-decision depression when they realize they chose wrong

#### 3. **Economic Access Barrier** üí∞

- Professional vocational guidance costs between $100-$400 USD
- Only available in large cities
- Middle-lower class families without access to these services

#### 4. **Disconnection from Labor Reality** üè¢

- Don't know real professionals in their areas of interest
- Romanticized vision of careers without knowing daily challenges
- Ignorance about real salaries, professional growth, and employability

#### 5. **Loneliness in the Process** ü§ù

- Completely individual decision-making
- No support community with young people in similar situations
- Lack of accessible mentors to guide the process

## üöÄ The Birth of Guide: From Frustration to Solution

### The Original Vision

One day, after seeing my younger sister cry because she didn't know what to study and my cousin drop out of Engineering in his second semester, I had an epiphany: **What if there was an app that was like having a guidance psychologist, an older brother, and a support community, all in your pocket?**

Guide was born with a clear mission: **Democratize vocational guidance in Mexico through empathetic artificial intelligence, accessible human mentors, and a real support community**.

### The Fundamental Principles

1. **Total Accessibility**: Free, lightweight, functional on basic smartphones
2. **Deep Personalization**: Each young person is unique, their guidance should be too
3. **Integrated Emotional Support**: Not just _what_ to study, but _how_ to handle process anxiety
4. **Real Human Connection**: AI + real mentors + genuine community
5. **Updated Information**: Real data from the Mexican job market

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built Guide: The Development Process

### Phase 1: Research and Validation (2 months)

- **100+ interviews** with young people aged 17-25 in Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey
- **50+ conversations** with guidance psychologists and vocational counselors
- **International competition analysis** (found nothing specific for Mexican context)
- **Problem validation** with educational institutions (UNAM, IPN, Tecnol√≥gico)

### Phase 2: Experience Design (1.5 months)

- **Design Thinking** centered on the Mexican user
- **Rapid prototyping** with Figma, testing with 30 young people
- **Empathetic conversational AI architecture** culturally relevant
- **Gamification system** that doesn't trivialize the decision process

### Phase 3: Technical Development (4 months)

#### Chosen Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: React Native + Expo (cross-platform, rapid development)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Real-time)
- **Conversational AI**: GPT-4 + Fine-tuning with Mexican data
- **Video Calls**: Agora.io for real-time mentoring
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel to understand user behavior

#### Key Technical Features:

```typescript
// Example of our adaptive vocational test algorithm
const adaptiveQuestionGenerator = {
  analyzeResponse: (previousAnswers) => {
    const personalityProfile = extractPersonality(previousAnswers);
    const interestAreas = identifyInterests(previousAnswers);
    const emotionalState = detectEmotionalState(previousAnswers);

    return generateNextQuestion({
      profile: personalityProfile,
      interests: interestAreas,
      emotional: emotionalState,
      mexicanContext: true, // Careers available in Mexico
    });
  },
};
```
